# SQL Learning

The SQL learning materials utilized in this repository have been sourced from [Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/), an online website for mastering SQL basics and applying them in various case studies. 

While there is a multitude of online resources available to learn SQL fundamentals, many of them fall short of offering case studies that delve into real business requirements and demonstrate how SQL can fulfill these data needs for corporations.

Below are summaries of what I learned and the type of analytical questions I answered via case studies.

## Data Exploration
- Order By
- Counts and Distinct Valves
- Identify Duplicate Records
- Summary Statistics
- Distribution Functions
- Health Analytics Mini Case Study

## Marketing Analytics Case Study
- Joins (LEFT, INNER, LEFT-SEMI JOIN, ANTI-JOIN)
- Window functions (ROW_NUMBER(), RANK(), DENSE_RANK(), PERCENT_RANK(), CUME_DIST())
LAG & LEAD & COALESCE
- `RANGE BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW`
    - RANGE, ROWS, GROUPS 
- Recursive CTEs
## People Analytics Case Study

1. What is the gender ratio in the department which has the highest average male salary and what is the average male salary value for that department?
1. HR Analytica want to change the average salary increase percentage value to 2 decimal places - what will the new value be for males for the company level dashboard?
