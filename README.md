# SQL Learning

The SQL learning materials utilized in this repository have been sourced from [Data With Danny](https://www.datawithdanny.com/), an online website for mastering SQL basics and applying them in various case studies. 

While there is a multitude of online resources available to learn SQL fundamentals, many of them fall short of offering case studies that delve into real business requirements and demonstrate how SQL can fulfill these data needs for corporations.

Below are summaries of what I learned and the type of analytical questions I answered via case studies.
